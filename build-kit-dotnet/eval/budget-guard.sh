# budget-guard.sh — hard spend/wall-clock kill switch for unattended agent
# invocations (Corrective Project Plan WS1.3). Wraps a single `claude` call
# the same way lib/agent.sh does, but doesn't reuse agent.sh itself — that
# file is explicitly documented as unmodified/shared (build-kit-dotnet/README.md),
# and getting real per-call cost/token data means switching to
# `--output-format json`, which agent.sh doesn't use. This script is the
# thing eval/run-slice.sh (and any future unattended loop) calls instead of
# `lib/agent.sh` directly.
#
# Enforces, per harness invocation of this script (cumulative across a
# single run-slice.sh run, tracked in a state file, reset per run):
#   - EVAL_MAX_COST_USD    (default 2.00)  — hard cumulative $ cap
#   - EVAL_MAX_WALLCLOCK_S (default 900)   — hard wall-clock cap PER CALL,
#                                            enforced via `timeout`, not just
#                                            measured after the fact
#
# On breach: refuses to make the call (if already over budget before
# starting) or reports the breach and exits non-zero (if the call itself
# pushed cumulative cost over the cap, or timed out) — the calling loop
# (run-slice.sh's retry loop) must check the exit code and stop, not retry
# through a budget breach.
#
# Usage: ./budget-guard.sh <state-file> ["<model>"] "<prompt>"
#   state-file — path to a JSON file tracking cumulative cost for this run
#                (created if absent; caller is responsible for using a
#                fresh path per harness run so budgets don't leak across runs)
#   model      — optional. An alias (sonnet/opus/fable) or full model id.
#                Omit to use whatever the `claude` CLI's own default is.
#                Pass explicitly whenever a fair cross-harness comparison
#                (e.g. against pi-budget-guard.sh) needs a pinned model.

# --bare (found 2026-09-08): this machine has a top-level firstmate/CLAUDE.md
# and firstmate/AGENTS.md above the K9Crush project directory implementing a
# real, separate multi-agent governance system ("never write to a project
# directly, delegate to a spawned crewmate"). That's a real, live system for
# this user's actual workflow, but it's a confound for an eval harness meant
# to measure raw coding capability, not exercise that governance layer.
# --bare disables CLAUDE.md auto-discovery (among other things) so this
# comparison measures the model, not whichever governance file happens to
# sit above the project directory.
